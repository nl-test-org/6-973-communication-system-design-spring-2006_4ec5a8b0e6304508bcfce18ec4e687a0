Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Tutorials: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

6.011 and 6.111

Topics
------

The course will focus on four major categories as outlined below:

1.  Introduction to digital communications
    *   Modulation and detection, vector channel representation
    *   Equalization
    *   Multi-channel systems (modulation methods, waterfiling, bit loading)
    *   Practical examples including 802.11a
    *   Coding – sequence detection, gap, convolutional and block codes
2.  ASIC design fundamentals
    *   ASIC design flow, tools, system-on-a-chip design issues
    *   Micro-architectures and transformations (parallelism, pipelining, folding, time-multiplexing)
    *   Hardware description languages: introduction to Bluespec™ and Verilog® review
3.  Theory and building blocks
    *   Fast fourier transform (theory, fast algorithms and VLSI implementations)
    *   Convolutional and Trellis codes, and Viterbi algorithm (theory, algorithms and VLSI implementations)
    *   Synchronization (phase and frequency tracking loops, algorithms and VLSI implementations)
    *   Block codes (Hamming, BCH, Reed-Solomon), basic theory and VLSI implementations
4.  Wireless channel fundamentals
    *   Properties and modeling (fading, Doppler effect,...)
    *   Channel estimation (theory and VLSI implementations)
